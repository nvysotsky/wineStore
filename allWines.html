                          <span style="color:red;">Chilean Pinot Noir</span> is one of the most criminally undervalued wine categories on the planet. 
                          Quite frankly I can’t believe it’s still the secret that it is to so many wine lovers. 
                          Pinot Noir is one of the single most popular grapes in the world. A “truism” people like to throw around is that there is 
                          no such thing as a good deal in Pinot Noir. Well Chile puts the lie to that pretty easily. 
                          One of the things that sets Chile apart from other wine growing countries is the large number of different microclimates, 
                          elevations, soil types and such that exist. With more diversity in their terroir than most countries they have the ability 
                          to do well with a wide array of grapes. Another specific thing they have in their favor is some 3,000 miles of coast line.
                           Pinot thrives in cooler climates and Chile has numerous vineyard sites that are tailor made for growing this notoriously 
                          difficult to master grape. Add to that the fact that most wine drinkers simply have yet to wrap their brain around great 
                          Pinot Noir coming from South America and you have a somewhat perfect storm of incredible values on terrific Pinot Noir loaded 
                          with varietal typicity.

                    “Spat” means “late” in German. In (that crazy) German noun compounding, Spat + Burgunder = “late-ripener from Burgundy”. That, in turn, means Pinot Noir. Chances are good you’ve never seen a bottle of <span style="color:red;">Spatburgunder</span>, much less tasted one, but hopefully that soon changes. Today over one-third of German wine is red, and Spatburgunder is the leading black grape. There’s so much that Germany ranks third in global plantings after France and the US.
                    So here’s the rub, as I alluded to before: German Spätburgunders may take some searching to find. Largely a white wine producing country, Germans are thirsty for their own reds (and import lots of others’, too.) Producers often don’t need to ship their wines elsewhere, but those determined to show the world their red gems do, albeit in small quantities.
                    Before you start hunting for these elusive liquids, you likely want to know what to expect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, generalizations are tough. It is possible to roughly divide these wines into two camps: one is more woodsy and earthy in style and the other is more fruit-driven and polished. The first genre seems more typical of other European Pinots. The second more resembles the New World. Many wines in the latter group long have been generously extracted and finished with a big dollop of new oak. This is changing gradually though, and these wines tend to be trimmer and wear less “make-up” with each passing vintage.
                    One clear difference across all the styles is the wines’ colors. They tend to show auburn and brown tones more quickly than Pinots from almost anywhere else in the world. This doesn’t make them taste any less lovely, but it may surprise the uninitiated more accustomed to hulky Russian River bottlings or even lighter-styled Oregon wines.

                    Christmas menus are already starting to engage the minds of chefs and one of them asked me last week for a wine match with his special recipe Christmas cake. I surprised him by suggesting Cava.
                    Cava has an impressive history to build on. The wine was born way back in 1872 although it was known as <span style="color:red;">‘Champan’ (Champagne)</span> then. The name Cava appeared for the first time in 1959 when customers asked for ‘cellar’ or ‘cave’ wine, hence Cava.
                    Vineyard soil analysis is now common practice. Casellroig have identified twelve soil types across their estate, (chalk, clay variations) and found three or four differentials with depth at each location, “we pick and vinify these different plots separately”, explains winemaker Marcel Sabate. Codorniu now hand pick single rows of grapes for individual vinification. To their credit, the Cava Crew are taking this quality stuff very seriously.
                    Cava’s made in same way as Champagne with the second fermentation in the bottle producing a little more alcohol and carbon dioxide – the fizz. For those who like lower alcohol wines, Cava’s typical 12% by volume will make you smile.
                    Better still, you can also impress by cracking open an aged Cava with your Christmas cake. A match that will bring a little sparkling Spanish sunshine into a chilly December day.

                    The sweet wines of <span style="color:red;">Tokaj</span>, Hungary have a pedigree going back centuries. In fact it was here in the late 16th century that someone first dreamed/dared to make a wine from grapes shriveled by the Botrytis cinerea fungus, aka noble rot. Sauternes is far better known these days, but Tokajiaszú wines were once favored by European royalty and great artists of the day such as Beethoven, Schubert and Goethe. The downward spiral began in 1885 when phylloxera decimated the vineyards. Further decline came with two world wars followed by four decades of Communism. Only in the last 25 years has the industry been able to rebuild and recapture some of its former glory.
                    One of the pioneers of Tokaji's renaissance is Royal Tokaji, which was founded in 1990 by Hugh Johnson, the noted British wine writer. The sweet, golden wines are made from three grape varieties: Furmint, Hárslevelű and Muscat de Lunel. The winemaking process itself has changed little over the centuries. The grapes shriveled by botrytis (aszú) are hand harvested individually and crushed into a thick, syrupy paste. This paste is then added to a base wine made from that year's harvest of unbotrytized grapes. Originally, the aszú grapes were collected in wooden barrels called puttonyos, which is the term still used today to indicate the level of sweetness. The more puttonyos, the sweeter the wine. They range from 3 to 6, followed by an even sweeter wine called essencia, which is made from free-run juice and not blended into a base wine (it's also extremely expensive). A wine with 5 puttonyos usually hits the right pleasure/price sweet spot, and this one from Royal Tokaji's Red Label is an elegant example. The deep orange color suggests a more viscous wine, but this is bright and lively, full of ripe peaches, apricots, pears and mandarin oranges with a gorgeous layer of botrytis. This could easily be dessert in itself, but would pair well with a peach pie or apricot tart.

                    Should you find yourself roasting marshmallows by a campfire, plan on having a bottle of <span style="color:red;">Banyuls</span> nearby. This port-like vindoux naturel from the Roussillon region in southern France is the perfect sip with s'mores. In fact it pairs well with anything chocolaty as well as desserts made with dark fruits, such as blackberry cobbler or plum tart.
                    Made predominantly with Grenache grapes grown along steep terraces above the Mediterranean Sea near the Spanish border, the wines are fortified while the grapes are still macerating, extracting a wide variety of flavors. Aging takes place in any number of vessels, including oak barrels and glass bonbonnes, depending on the producers desired style. Some seek to preserve the ripe red fruit flavors, while others seek the rancio notes (walnuts, caramel) that come from long aging and heat. The wines come in two tiers of quality. Grand Cru Banyuls must be aged a minimum of 30 months in wood, while regular Banyuls must be aged between 4 and 20 months. This wine from the Domaine de la Casa Blanca was aged in oak barrels for one year before being bottled. It's silky smooth and sweet but balanced by a racy acidity, with a complex array of jam-like fruit flavors (raspberry, strawberry and damson), and a hint of dried cranberries and figs.
